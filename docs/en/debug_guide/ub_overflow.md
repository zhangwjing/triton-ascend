# UB Overflow Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

UB space insufficiency is a common issue in Triton-Ascend development. This document provides detailed information about common causes, solutions, and debugging methods for UB Overflow.

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. Using Interface Parameters That Increase UB Overhead

Certain interfaces automatically add additional processing logic under specific parameter configurations, resulting in increased UB space usage:

#### `propagate_nan` Parameter for `tl.maximum`, `tl.minimum`, and `tl.clamp` Interfaces

**Issue Description:**
When setting `propagate_nan=tl.PropagateNAN.NONE`, the system automatically adds NaN value detection and processing logic.

**Impact:**

- Significantly increases UB space usage
- May cause performance degradation

**Solutions:**

- If input data does not contain NaN values or strict NaN processing semantics are not required, consider adjusting the `propagate_nan` parameter value
- In scenarios with limited UB space, prioritize parameter configurations that do not trigger additional NaN processing

### 2. Excessive Intermediate Variables

**Problem:**
The kernel defines a large number of temporary tensors or intermediate computation results.

**Solutions:**

- Reduce unnecessary intermediate variables
- Reuse allocated buffers
- Split large computations into multiple smaller kernels

### 3. Large Data Types and Shapes

**Problem:**
Using larger data types such as fp64, bf16, or processing high-dimensional/large shape tensors.

**Solutions:**

- Consider splitting large tensors into blocks for processing
- Modify blocking strategies to reduce the size of each block
- Use smaller data types (e.g., fp16 instead of fp32) while meeting precision requirements

### 4. Complex Control Flow or Loops

**Problem:**
The kernel contains complex conditional statements or multi-level nested loops.

**Solutions:**

- Simplify control flow logic
- Reduce loop nesting levels or iteration counts
- Split complex logic into multiple kernels

## Debugging Recommendations

1. **Enable Detailed Logging**
   - Use `TRITON_DEBUG=1` to obtain detailed compilation information
   - Locate which specific operator causes UB overflow

2. **Step-by-Step Troubleshooting**
   - Comment out parts of the code to locate the specific operation causing the issue
   - Use binary search approach to quickly identify problematic code sections

3. **Refer to Documentation**
   - Check the "Special Limitations" section in each interface documentation
   - Understand parameter configurations that may increase UB overhead

4. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Prioritize handling operators that consume significant UB space
   - Consider redesigning algorithms to reduce intermediate variables
   - Consider modifying blocking strategies
